General Notes
-------------

The system expects that we take money from the cash box right away.
If you don't want to (or there is e.g. not enough money), put money
on your credit account instead (see above).  Please always do that
(never *I'll remember and I'll take money later*) so that there is
a record that the cash box and system records are not in sync and
there are no irregularities.

To enter text (or numbers too), you can use both the on-screen keyboard
and the physical keyboard nearby.
